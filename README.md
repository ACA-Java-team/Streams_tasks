# Streams_tasks
In this repository you should upload your homeworks connected with Streams. <br />
**There are two important rules you should follow in this repository**
1. You should create your own directory inside Streams_tasks directory with your username. For example mine is gharutyunyan.
2. When you solved task number 4 then your project name should be task_4. For example if I solved task number 4 I will create in Streams_tasks/gharutyunyan/task_4 directory and will add all relevant files there.


All questions below you should solve using **streams**, **lyambdas** and **method references**.
- Task 1: You have a Person class which has a "name" field. You are given List of Persons.
    - 1.1 Print all Persons whose names start with latter 'A'.
    - 1.2 Print number of Persons whose names start with latter 'A'.
- Task 2: Print numbers from 1 to 10.
- Task 3: Print sum of numbers from 4 to 10.
- Task 4: Write a function with printSortedFirst name which gives as a parameter List of String.
        Inside function sort the List after prints first element if it exists(Note List can be empty!)
